This is a *great* resource! I think the community aspect in particular, can be so helpful to someone starting out on their journey to becoming a software engineer.

## Ryans Cho's Comments

I remember starting out with FreeCodeCamp back in High School!  Its definitely a great resource
and shows that really anybody with access to a computer can learn how to code.  The community
aspect is also super encouraging when you are first starting out.
